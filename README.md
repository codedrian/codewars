# Vocabolary:
* Kata: is an algorithm you have to solve in any programming language you desire.
* Kyu: is a digit that determines kata difficulty level as well as the user rank on the platform
# Purpose:
* I believe that the best way to learn is by doing. Practicing algorithm problems could help you to improve your problem-solving skills and become a better programmer.
